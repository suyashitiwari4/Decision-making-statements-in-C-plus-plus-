# Decision-making-statements-in-C-plus-plus-
AIM:To study and implement C++ decision making statements.
APPARATUS: VS Code
THEORY:
1	if statement
An ‘if’ statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
2	if...else statement
An ‘if’ statement can be followed by an optional ‘else’ statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false.
3	switch statement
A ‘switch’ statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
4	nested if statements
You can use one ‘if’ or ‘else if’ statement inside another ‘if’ or ‘else if’ statement(s).
5	nested switch statements
You can use one ‘switch’ statement inside another ‘switch’ statement(s).
ALGORITHM:
For if-else:(eg: to check wether number is even or odd)
1.Start
2. Take number as input.
3. if number%2==0,it is even else odd.
4.stop
For switch :(eg: to create a calculator using switch case)
1.Start
2.Take choice as input
3.switch(choice)
  case 1:ADDITION(a+b)
        break;
  case2:SUBTRACTION(a-b)
         break;
  case3:MULTIP;LICATION(a*b)
         break;
  case4:DIVISION(a/b)
         break;
  default:INVALID CHOICE
         break;
  4.Stop
  Conclusion:Hence we have learned to implement C++ decision making statements
